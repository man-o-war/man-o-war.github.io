I've made quite many projects of different complexity but there actual application code was lost after my hard disk crashed. So not many have running demos. But anywho, I've learnt my lesson now most of my code is on cloud services and my Github account.

Here are a few listed

* Machine Translator
* CS-HPI TS Analysis - HomeLLC Project assignment
* Consumer Behavious analysis
* Sentiment Analysis of IMDB reviews

> More stuff to be added later, Please keep on checking, I'll post in detail about them as my blog posts too, but later. This page will actually be converted into a live showcase so stay tuned.
