Hey There!

Welcome to my site. Its a work in progress so be a little easy on me.

I am Animesh, born and brought up in India. I graduated back in 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from Manipal University. The reason for me opting for such a degree programme wasn't merely the awesome curriculum. But rather I took it upon as my interests aligned with it. You see, if I want to see myself doing something on the long run, it can only relate to two things, Computers and Space (Cosmos). After that and many different jobs down, I'm now volunteering as a Data Scientist for a Japanese startup, Socious, which aims at creating a new kind of professional social network for impactful jobs.

Apart from this, I do some freelance work, mostly as any Software Engineer. Presently I'm doing a freelance web project for NAMES India (prev Next Automation Engineers). But this is not my limit. I like reading books and articles. Please feel free to checkout my [Bookshelf](../bookshelf/).

I also like to write. Until the creation of this website I used to do that over on my [Medium](https://medium.com/aniskywalker) blog, but from now it will be on both Medium and here. I have RSS enabled. So feel free to add that to your reader's lists. Sometimes I do like to write prose and poetry too.

I do like playing my violin and learning languages. I am bilingual in English and Hindi, my native. I am presently learning French, B1 level, and Russian, TEU-A1, (Not yet certified in either). I also have elementary knowledge of Japanese and Spanish.

I have a knack for photography too. My photography portfolio will be live soon as a separate website. Feel free to check back and buy yourself some prints. For now you can visit over to my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/aniskywalker0117), which is private. Just send me a request and ping me a message I'll accept. And also my [Vero](https://vero.co/ani_skywalker) profile, its public don't worry.

### Future Aspirations

> As of now I am aspiring to pursue Master in Computer Sciences with specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to gain the knowledge and expertise required to build technologies to later work on exciting projects as a Software Research Engineer. In the long run, I wish to continue researching, get a Ph.D. and eventually start multiple product based ventures in the Healthcare, Space and Robotics sector. Maybe Fin-tech too.
